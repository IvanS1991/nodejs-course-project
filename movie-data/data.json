Under those circumstances, the young couple of Jan and Antonina Zabinski continue their daily routine as owners and keepers of the Warsaw Zoo, but soon, as German Luftwaffe's Stukas hammer the Polish capital, their life's work together with the city, will turn to ashes. However, with the zoo liquidated for the war effort and many of its animals tragically perished, what was once an animals' zoo, will now serve as a sanctuary where Antonina, the humanist veterinarian, and Jan can hide the persecuted Polish Jews in plain sight until safe houses are found. That was Jan and Antonina's formidable, yet perilous plan, who regardless of the consequences, refused to wither before the Nazi menace, took matters into their own hands and sheltered 300 Jews under the Germans' noses.","rating":57,"director":"Niki Caro","cast":[{"actor":"Jessica Chastain","character":"Antonina Zabinska"},{"actor":"Johan Heldenbergh","character":"Jan Zabinski"},{"actor":"Daniel Brühl","character":"Lutz Heck"},{"actor":"Timothy Radford","character":"Ryszard Zabinski (Younger)"},{"actor":"Efrat Dor","character":"Magda Gross"},{"actor":"Iddo Goldberg","character":"Maurycy Fraenkel"},{"actor":"Shira Haas","character":"Urszula"},{"actor":"Michael McElhatton","character":"Jerzyk"},{"actor":"Val Maloku","character":"Ryszard Zabinski (Older)"},{"actor":"Martha Issová","character":"Regina Kenigswein"},{"actor":"Daniel Ratimorský","character":"Samuel Kenigswein"},{"actor":"Frederick Preston","character":"Miecio Kenigswein"},{"actor":"Theo Preston","character":"Stefcio Kenigswein       (as Theodore Preston)"},{"actor":"Viktoria Zakharyanova","character":"Stefania Keningswein"},{"actor":"Goran Kostic","character":"Mr. Kinszerbaum"}],"id":614,"_id":"5981c2c9ff46ef18d8ea8900"},{"title":"The Last Face","year":"2016","duration":"2h 10min","imgSrc":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1NTU3OTcyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDY5Njc3MDI@._V1_UY268_CR7,0,182,268_AL_.jpg","genres":["Drama"],"description":"A director (Charlize Theron) of an international aid agency in Africa meets a relief aid doctor (Javier Bardem) amidst a political/social revolution, and together face tough choices surrounding humanitarianism and life through civil unrest.","rating":16,"director":"Sean Penn","cast":[{"actor":"Charlize Theron","character":"Wren"},{"actor":"Javier Bardem","character":"Miguel Leon"},{"actor":"Adèle Exarchopoulos","character":"Ellen"},{"actor":"Jared Harris","character":"Dr. John Farber"},{"actor":"Jean Reno","character":"Dr. Love"},{"actor":"Denise Newman","character":"Sarie"},{"actor":"Oscar Best","character":"Doctor Brown"},{"actor":"Zubin Cooper","character":"Moussa"},{"actor":"Sebelethu Bonkolo","character":"Sam"},{"actor":"Hopper Penn","character":"Billy Boggs       (as Hopper Jack Penn)"},{"actor":"Merritt Wever","character":"Marie"},{"actor":"Tina Jaxa","character":"Winnie"},{"actor":"Olga Gainullina","character":""},{"actor":"Dominika Jablonska","character":"News Reporter"},{"actor":"Irina Miccoli","character":"Guest"}],"id":615,"_id":"5981c2c9ff46ef18d8ea8901"},{"title":"The Departed","year":"2006","duration":"2h 31min","imgSrc":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI1MTY2OTIxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjQ4NjY3._V1_UX182_CR0,0,182,268_AL_.jpg","genres":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"description":"In South Boston, the state police force is waging war on Irish-American organized crime.
